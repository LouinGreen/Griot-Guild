Less than a month later and about 100 miles away, the Wright Brothers would successfully create and fly the first ever working airplane named the Kitty Hawk. It was almost as if the birth of the young Robinson gave humanity permission to fly, what a coincidence that the man who would soon be known as the Brown Condor and one of the greatest pilots would be born a few weeks before the invention of aviation. When he was a baby Robinson's father had died and he and his four year old sister were raised by his mother Bertha and step father Charles Cobb. In 1910 at the age of seven years old Robinson spent his time on the beach of Gulfport Mississipi watching one of the first ever float equipped biplanes piloted by John Moissant fly overhead. Many who watched him grow up state that this was the moment he decided to be a pilot and the moment the Brown Condor was truly born.  (Citations at bottom of page, [1] [2] [3] ) </p>

            <p data-scroll-class="scroll-class" data-scroll-repeat="true" data-scroll-direction="vertical" data-scroll data-scroll-speed="10" class="custom-p">In 1919 Robinson was forced out of school at the age of 16. His highschool, Gulfport High School for the Colored practiced a form of systemic racism that many American Highschools enforced during this time that barred blacks from going to school after the tenth grade. For the last 300 years the government enforced strict laws usually with violence and imprisonment that made it illegal for blacks to get an education. Robinson however, had already developed a fascination for machinery and mechanics and with the persistence of an anime protaganist, he continued to dream of avaiation. Our protaganist proceeded to attend the  Tuskegee Institute of Alabama in 1921 at the age of 19 where he studied automotive mechanical science, math, literature, composition and history with a focus on automobiles while working as a shoeshine man. He graduated in three years and would spend the duration of this time applying to Curtiss-Wright School of Aviation in Chicago which would continue to reject him due to not accepting black students. Robinson was unable to find any siutable work even remotely related to his passion or expertise due to racism and had stated at the time, "The garage owners will give me a job sweeping, filling gas tanks, changing tires, or washing, but I'm an engine man When I talk to them about automotive science they smile, look at each other, and then look at me like I belong behind a mule and a plow. [3]" He later moved to detroit but still could not find work that his eduacation should have guraunteed him mainly due to the fact that he had more extensive knowledge than his white employers and thus would'nt be hired due to racist sentiments. Finally he got work as a mechanics assistance and survived racism from his coworkers as he worked his way up to a mechanic. In a streak of luck a taxi driver named Fitzgerald offered to triple his salary if he worked for him however Robinson later chose to leave the mans employment due to Fitzgerald running an illegal bootlegging ring during prohibition. This would propel Robinson towards working for himslef and getting his own garage however even this wasn't enough to cease his dreams of flight. (Citations at bottom of page, [1] [2] [3] )</p>

            <p data-scroll-class="scroll-class" data-scroll-repeat="true" data-scroll-direction="vertical" data-scroll data-scroll-speed="10" class="custom-p">After repairing an engine on a Curtis JN-JD plane for a pilot named Percy, another pilot named Robert allowed Robinson to fly his Waco 9 plane. This taste if flight would birth a never before hunger in Robinson to get back into the air. Now that he knew he could fly, he also knew he had to. Robinson was now married to his wife Earnize and working as an auto mechanic in Chicago out of a garage in Bronzeville on 47th Street in 1927. He never gave up on aviation and despite being rejected for the last 5 years by Curtiss-Wright Robinson found other creative ways to pursue his dream. One of those ways was by becoming a janitor Curtis Wright. He figured if he couldn't get into the school to learn flight then he would get in doing the only thing they thought black men capable of, custodial work. On Saturday nights he would take notes directly off of chalk boards on his breaks and in the evening he would listen in to classes while he worked. While possibly inspiring movies like Good Will Hunting or Step Up Robinson was able to surround himself around like minded individuals by networking while working as a janitor. He was now able to create the Brown Eagle Aero Club and invited local black mechanical and aviation enthusiast like himself which he had met at the school he cleaned. He later bought a kit for a build it yourself airplane and with help from friends such as Cornelius Coffey the future legendary aviator (who would later help the future renowned Willa Brown build the first black aviation school) he was able to build it in his garage using a retrofitted motorcycle engine. While going full Tony Stark the group realized they needed more space, so they moved the project to the Melrose Park Airport where Robinson would meet key contacts such as Bill Henderson the very professor whose class Robinson cleaned as a janitor. When Robinson told the professor that he built an airplane so he could finally fly again the professor was in disbelief and asked if he could test it out. The plane flew perfectly and Henderson was so impressed that he secured Robinson a spot at Curtis Wright. Under Professor Snyder Robinson quickly became a licensed pilot, graduated at the top of his class as a master mechanic in 1931 and immediately worked towards convincing the school to allow his fellow african american friends to join. He was able to get every one of his friends to join and all of whom soon became licensed pilots themselves starting the era of legendary African American aviators. He and his friend Cornelius Coffey also created an organization called the Challenger Air Pilots Association for African Americans wanting to fly. These major steps would be the start of many great careers in aviation for many African Americans. Just to further pave the road for young African Americans Robinson and Coffey opened their own airfield in Robins, Illinois called the John Robinson school of aviation. Robinson then convinced his old school the Tuskegee Institute to open a school of aviation so that young black enthusiast as himself would have the option to fly from the start. if it weren't for this move by Robinson the Famous Tuskegee Airmen would have never existed. It also goes to note that Robinson worked as professor at Curtis Wright after he graduated and would personally teach the first young black memebers of the fabled Tuskegee Airmen himself earning him the nickname "Father of the Tuskegee Airmen".

            <p data-scroll-class="scroll-class" data-scroll-repeat="true" data-scroll-direction="vertical" data-scroll data-scroll-speed="10" class="custom-p">In 1935 the second Italo-Ethiopian War was in full swing after Mussolini was installed as the dictator of Italy and colonizer of Libya. The fascist dictator had his eyes set on Ethiopia, a country that had never been colonized and had defeated europe multiple times in antiquity. Robinson viewed the African country as a symbol of of black resistence like most Africans and African Americans so he announced to a group of black business owners and leaders in Chicago that he would assist the African country it's war with Italy. Robinson also wanted to establish an airforce in Ethiopia to progress global political consciousness as well as work in a better environment. America had rampant white givernment sanctioned terrorist mobs such as the KKK which would lynch blacks by the thousands. Robinson got the attention of Malaku Bayen who was a relative of Ethiopia's Emperor Haile Selassie. The Emperor Selassie had gotten fame in the states due to his rebellion against Europe as well as his part in single handedly starting the Rastafarian Movement. Robinson arrived in Africa after already getting recognition for his all black military pilots in the states. Robinson set up a training school close to Addis Ababa where he trained the first of Ethiopia's new air force. While training he managed to get in a fist fight with another legendary pilot from Africa named Hubert Julian aka the Black Eagle. The black Eagle was kicked out of the country by Emperor Selassie (The Lion). After this Robinson became commander of the Ethiopian air force. Robinson would engage in multiple skirmishes, reconnaissance and training missions during his time in africa as well as witness many atroccities and war crimes committed by Italy. Unfortuntely Robinson just did not have enough time with the Ethiopians to get them prepared for Italys superior air force as they attacked less than a year after his arrival. When Robinson returned home he was greeted like a hero. Women showered him in bouquets and he was escorted via motorcade to give a speech in front of thousands. There is alot more to The Brown Condor's story not covered in this article. I beg to read more as this man was far too impressive to be forgotten. The Lion and the Condor is a great book covering Selassie and Robinsons relationship. Robinsons story reminds us how one person through perserverence and creativity, can pave the way for generaations to come. (Citations at bottom of page, [1] [2] [3])</p>
